What problem does this technology solve?
In a nutshell, Sass makes CSS more capable in two ways. It helps you dry out your css and adds modularity. For our first project at WDI, Sass may not be particularly helpful since the CSS file probably isn't very large. As you scale the projects/CSS files, Sass becomes increasingly helpful.

How do you use it? Is there a "cheatsheet" you found or made that others can reference?
Install it (gem install sass) and tell sass which folders to look out for (sass --watch path/sass-directory).
Students can reference my powerpoint and the Sass website is very helpful (http://sass-lang.com/guide).

What did you build with this technology? (demo)
